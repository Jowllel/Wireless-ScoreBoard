This project revolves around the development of the Wireless ScoreBoard Remote V1.0, aimed at creating a portable scoreboard that can be operated by an active player during games like volleyball. The documentation covers essential elements such as the project mindmap, "Pflichtenheft," research and development on triggers and battery charging, design of the remote PCB, and the development of the remote case. Additionally, insights from project interviews, project agreements, and progress updates are included to offer a comprehensive view of the project's evolution and milestones. Through this documentation, I aim to showcase the planning, execution, and outcomes of the Wireless ScoreBoard Remote project.
